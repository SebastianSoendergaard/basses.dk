<h1>Developer testing</h1>
Below I have colleded a number of videos that in my opinion gives some good insights on how to do testing.

<h3>TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong - by Ian Cooper</h3>
Talks about how most do testing and why TDD to some has a bad reputation <br />
Tells how TDD should in fact be practiced <br />

Main takaways: <br />
<ul>
    <li>tests that is tighly coupled to implementation will break too often thus becomming frustrating</li>
    <li>a unit is not a single class ot method, it is a module with a defined interface, that will rarely change</li>
    <li>the module should be seen as a black box so testing should only be on input and output</li>
    <li>the internal of the module is implementation details that should be allowed to change frequently</li>
    <li>test should focus on behaviour instead of data</li>
    <li>TDD is basically the same as BDD</li>
</ul>  
<br />

<h3>Building Operable Software with TDD (but not the way you think) - by Martin Thwaites</h3>
Suggests testing from the outside in, starting with the public API, either HTTP API or a SDK API<br />

Main takaways: <br />
<ul>
    <li>yes tests can include database and other infrastructure calls, and it can still be very fast </li>
    <li>by testing from the public API you do not couple the tests to implementation or infrastructure, so that can still change</li>
    <li>endpoint paths, routing, dependency injection are all automatically tested </li>
    <li>actually you get 100% coverage, if code is not covered, you are either missing a test or you have dead code </li>
    <li>some stuff can not be verified through API, but by including tracing it can be done</li>
</ul>
